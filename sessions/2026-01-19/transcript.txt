Speaker A: The last time we were talking with.
Speaker B: Daniel.
Speaker A: He was using the Chrome extension to transcribe his.
Speaker B: Speech.
Speaker A: Idiot.
Speaker B: Idiot.
Speaker A: Cat.
Speaker B: Anyway, I started it. Okay.
Speaker A: So. So yeah, Daniel was. Was using the Chrome extension to transcribe his speech and to find some mistakes in. I don't know, maybe in pronunciation too, but mostly in. In using words so in dictionary.
Speaker B: So do you have this extension only for Google Meet.
Speaker A: It's working. Only for Google Meet. It works.
Speaker B: Okay, we will check it later.
Speaker A: You can wipe code something for it just or local.
Speaker B: I think it's just needed to check. I hope some efficient instruments should have in place. And what is the difference between errors and mistakes in our context?
Speaker A: I used to see the errors in interface mostly so I can't explain what the difference between these words but in context I know that if you. If we're talking about. So I think maybe. Maybe mistakes that something you did and errors and something happened by itself. Maybe I don't.
Speaker B: Some more.
Speaker A: You know.
Speaker B: One more time please. Mistakes it what you can make and errors. It happens by itself. Okay, maybe. Okay. So do you have any English aim or purpose for this year? Maybe some. Maybe some level or some vocabulary on something like that? No.
Speaker A: No. There is no reason, no goals for it. We started to practice with. We started our practice with Dania at the end of November of last year just to. Just to. Just to practice because Dana is learning English in Germany. He needs the B1 or B2 level to work to find some work. And I thought at this moment I thought it would be nice to communicate more with Daniel sometimes and also practice English because our level D now is maybe similar just speaking level. Before eight years ago, I was more confident in my level. I speak more fluently. And now I think now I have some troubles. And also when I'm speaking with the international worldwide clients, sometimes it seems like a problem for me. So I just want to speak more fluent. So I started to practice and also I have an idea to create the local mini English speaking club for Russian designers. And maybe we can grow that's into something bigger. So that's useful for me and interesting to try.
Speaker B: Okay. Have you ever visited any English community in Russia? Small talk groups online?
Speaker A: When I worked in Ray Peasant bank there was a bank, there was a local English club one time per sprint or per week, I can't recall. And it was really good because you can practice with the presentations and also you can practice in English. So you can choose the topic for the meeting and on the meeting you can prepare the presentation before the meeting. And you can describe your idea only with English. That was good.
Speaker B: And.
Speaker A: That'S it. That's. That's the one experience.
Speaker B: Okay. I visited a couple of times when I came to Moscow. The first time in 2014 years. And it was like a game munchkin and one game, I don't remember how it's called. And I mostly was sitting like this and eating and as I remember everyone should order some meal. It was in restaurant and for me it was quite hard to order. Total amount 1000 rubles. So I just drinking a tea as I remember. So it wasn't very efficient for me I suppose because of my level was too low compared to other group. But currently I think it must be much more efficient.
Speaker A: Okay. So I think the. For me it seems a little bit useless because when you play you can improve your playing English. So it's different. Yeah. So because when I was playing in Counter Strike when I was playing in Dota with the international mates. So it was useful for me and I thought my. At this time I thought my English is very nice because I can communicate with the other people from other countries. I played with people from Poland, from Europe, from usa, from China also. So I imagined. So I imagined that my English is nice. Yeah but I. But I needed to improve it. When I needed to improve my level for the visa interview, I was disappointed about my level. So the plain English is different from real real English. So also when we speak with Dania we use special design topics or industry topics IT topics to improve the professional English to know just to learn new words to try to speak more fluent. And also sometimes it seems easy because we already use some words in Russia like you know, the interface in Figma when we drawing we use words rectangle so we don't speak primovolnik we just use the rectangle or screen screenshot interface. That's Anglicism in Russia what we use.
Speaker B: Brother, I suggest to keep your answers a little bit shorter so we have a discussion because sometimes I feel a.
Speaker A: Little bit boring idea of my. My speeches. We have to prepare some topics, not just try to speak. We have to prepare topics. Startup topics maybe.
Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I have a question how you understand your fluency level and second questions. How how you think we can evaluate our fluency level during the time. I have one idea. I can explain you, but maybe you have another one.
Speaker A: Repeat the first question.
Speaker B: First question, how we can evaluate our fluency level and progress of it.
Speaker A: And this is second question.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: What's the first one?
Speaker B: First one, how we can evaluate the currently our current fluency level and how you can understand that you have progress in it. Two questions.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think just for both situations we can use transcribe AI soft for it. For example we can, we can set up. It's hard, it's hard to explain. We can use transcribe AI soft to see how much words we can speak through the 30 minutes for example. So we can start it just then transcribe and.
Speaker B: Compare. Compare.
Speaker A: So we can compare the amount of text.
Speaker B: Yes, agree. I have the same idea. And the second metric can be the total amount of mistakes in this volume of text. So then higher your volume of text and lower your level of mistakes. So then higher your fluence level. I suppose.
Speaker A: I don't think so.
Speaker B: Because.
Speaker A: Quantity of mistakes. So big quantity of mistakes doesn't mean that you speak slow. You can make mistakes, but you can speak fluently.
Speaker B: Okay. But anyway if you increase your level of text of words and you have the same amount of mistakes so it means that you your speech is more fluent, it's higher, it's higher temp. So because I just. Because just I would like to turn one and half or maybe two speed up and when I listening and I also would like to speed up my own speech when I speaking.
Speaker A: Yeah. I don't like the sounds between the words. So now I think now.
Speaker B: I have.
Speaker A: Some troubles in pronunciation and also I have some troubles with thinking because when your English is fluent you can speak. You can just speak. But now when I'm speaking before I have to think and then I have to speak.
Speaker B: Do you need Russian?
Speaker A: Then translate and then speak. So that's a big problem for me. And that's because no practice.
Speaker B: So when you went to America last time, did you have the same problem or you have lack of it after one, two, three months there?
Speaker A: I fixed this after maybe two weeks in America because when you're working in English speaking area, I don't know the how to translate another way. Not area environment. Yeah. So when you, when you work in English speaking environment with English speaking people, you have to. You have to be adaptive.
Speaker B: So okay, yeah, I fixed it. And one, one hit. Not hit how it would be one life hack that I came take from my lesson. My English teacher, he said that you need you. He means me myself. He said that you need to explain English words in English words. So you shouldn't say sridha. You have to explain to me this word. So I need to understand and suggest you ways to pronounce it to say.
Speaker A: That yeah, yeah, yeah, that's. That's good advice. So I used. I used the same advice for Dania when we were speaking.
Speaker B: Yeah. And it was interesting. That exists English vocabulary to explain such kind of words. Any words in English. It's quite strange, but it's like a big Russian vocabulary of dal or ov. So Russian boards explained by Russian boards. By the way, are you going to take English tutor during this year?
Speaker A: I don't think so. I have two or three already paid paid lessons on platform.
Speaker B: Me too, by the way. Me too. I have maybe $100 of deposit if it's still available for me. I don't know, maybe even 500. 500 deposit in my Italki account. I remember I credited my account because of. It was maybe in 2022 year when credit cards or debit cards should be closed. If I'm not mistaken.
Speaker A: When I was applying to I can't recall the name of company from Portugal.
Speaker B: Can't recall. Can't recall. You said can't recall?
Speaker A: Yeah, recall, recall. So you try to. Just like you remember, you know the remember word. You know, remember.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So do you know what does mean recall?
Speaker B: Yes. Recall means when you call back your message or something like that.
Speaker A: No, no. Recall in your mind that you try to. To find something in your mind and you find it when you find you recall. If you can't find something in your head, you can't recall. So something happened a few time ago, a few years ago and you try to recall it.
Speaker B: So can you. Can you say your sentence one more time again fully?
Speaker A: Yeah, I can't recall the name of company. I can't recall the name of company.
Speaker B: Okay. It means that you can't in 2023. So you. You forgot it.
Speaker A: Yeah, I forgot and I can't recall.
Speaker B: Yeah, I understand.
Speaker A: So what I was talking about. Yeah, I was trying to. To be a part of Portugal company usp and I bought maybe five or six lessons on Russian platform to prepare for interview. So like. Like it was special, not special course, special lessons from the, from the teacher. So I have two or three more lessons on my account, but I didn't use it. I don't use. Maybe. Maybe I have to use it if it's alive, still alive, but we'll see. So I. I don't have any special purpose for this year. So I don't know my need. Need to. To use teacher for it.
Speaker B: Okay. I hope my $500 are still alive. So I had a question. Okay. So do you have some special thing for today or I can also. Or I can suggest.
Speaker A: You can suggest. I don't have.
Speaker B: Okay, I can't.
Speaker A: But I can't go to perplexity. I had some topics we discussed with Dania and I have some empty.
Speaker B: Okay, we can discuss today's. Today's pitch for Hartman. As you remember, one time per month he visited such kind of.
Speaker A: Pitches. And that's not discussion, that's just.
Speaker B: Yeah, I can. I can. I can tell you what came to my attention today's. No one was succeeded to invest only one team with Agrillo Apollo which is Skolkow residence. And who did investors service. Hartman said that he's ready to keep in touch in some way. And interesting was his mention about churn of lovable. He said that churn's low able is about 19% for me it was quite strange figures. I google it and find nothing about such disaster figures. So maybe he knows something that I don't know. But maybe he missed something or. Or it's incorrect information or something. So what else interesting? This Vladimir Pankhose who is making startups with glasses. Yes. He said that revenue from 1.1 store in his firm is about. From 4 till 10 million rubles. I don't remember. Was it about revenue or. Or net profit? I suppose it's revenue, but he said that it's from three to five times higher than usual optic stores. And it's quite interesting because I. I don't remember. Did I. Did I send you photos of their clubs? Optic clubs?
Speaker A: I don't think so. Maybe just the slide from presentation.
Speaker B: Oh, by the way, you can check it in love.comor.
Speaker A: True.
Speaker B: So it's quite interesting. I don't remember where he's working. He. He said he's from Yakutia or some north region. And as I'm if I'm not mistaken, they have five or seven.
Speaker A: I see the pictures.
Speaker B: What.
Speaker A: What does it mean?
Speaker B: Clubs collapse means store.
Speaker A: Conception. This is a part of conception.
Speaker B: Yes. And it's interesting to understand too in which cities they are represented. Yeah, he's. Their company is registered in Yakutsk.
Speaker A: Yeah. There is a five. Oh no, five. Not five. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Seven addresses.
Speaker B: Seven. Yes. So let me check the revenue of their company. Official revenue. Interesting. 100 million rubles and net profit is. Net loss for 40 million rubles.
Speaker A: 40 million for the last year.
Speaker B: Yes, for the previous year. Interesting. So it's interesting that for some quite special type of business. Maybe not type of business, but style of this kind of business, they have Solid revenue for your Kusk. Just interesting case like maybe like Chico as you remember Chico is Korean store. Korean food store. Yep so what interesting today was else. So Glasses Ah it was Glasses it was investment service Third service was about. Content Content maker Content factory. Content factory. Yes they they have a lot of phones registered in Kazakhstan and maybe something like that and they they concept they are not generate UCG content mostly they distributed it from their customers their clients so their suggestion is too efficient way to distribute content that already created and.
Speaker A: Hartman said looks looks same with the idea I was talking about today named Buffer the social media planner.
Speaker B: If I understand correctly the idea of Buffer the Buffer it's when you just. It's just about timing or distribution through different platform. Yes yes but but main idea of service which was presented to Hartman is to boost such kind of content.
Speaker A: So.
Speaker B: They they guaranteed for instance rates 100 ruples per 1000 views so it's not. You can. If you use Buffer you can post your content in 100 social medias but it can be not viewed at all and this company guaranteed that it will be boosted or distributed and you will have some how I would say views.
Speaker A: Yeah, I got it.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Each rich or what?
Speaker B: Yes okay and what else Java I was not interested in it but the mostly interested theme in this project was a founder it was a quite young girl and she. She. She take about 500 meetings per month during a month maybe it was only one month and her conversion her conversion rate to sale was about 20% and it was impressive. Yes it impressed Hartmont as well and he said you don't need to raise money just go through couple of months in this temp what is the synonym of temp? I'm not sure the temp is the right what here Pace maybe pace same speed speed or pace base it's like and so it's it's for project and was five. Don't remember. So just ah. Where is Vasily Vlebnikov is investor what is the project? It's what's about Glasses that's it I suppose 55 proof 5th project is not going to mention we have 31 minutes I suggest to stop because it's quite so so it's one slot during which we can evaluate our metrics I can make a Google Doc and we will put this our metrics in every time and one concern that I have that AI will be good enough in determination of determine if determine in definition of mistakes in correct way. Let's.
Speaker A: Let's check we have to check some tools. So we can try to use maybe different tools. For example, we can use for the transcribation, we can use something like Super Whisper or Fathom or something like that for the full transcribe meeting. And also we can use Google extension to check mistakes. And it will be like the combination of tools but we have to use Google Meet this way.
Speaker B: Okay, let's try. So that's it for this time?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: In bye bye Brand.
