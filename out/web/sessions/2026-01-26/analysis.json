  "transcript": "Speaker A: Let me start my voice recorder. Yes, it started.\n\nSpeaker B: Did you install the new one?\n\nSpeaker A: Not. Not yet. I've checked the description and it seems quite hard to deploy and I forgot find no feedback about this program. I. I found the founder or developer of this GitHub distribution and it was a project for university and he worked like intern slash developer. So I'm not sure how is it good in production way or so or something like that. So I try to find something else and maybe maybe the description from Bisovka that who is using MacWhisper for raw transcript txtf files maybe quite good decision. You can try it on your MacBook.\n\nSpeaker B: I'm on. I'm not on MacBook right now. I'm on Mac Mini so there is no know this so on my MacBook I have a super wister as I think a bit same like you talking about. But there is no split. There is no splitting to speakers and. But there is full transcription transcribe transcription description of meeting. It's just recording all thing that you said.\n\nSpeaker A: Could you repeat? I'm not sure that I understand correctly.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I have the same soft on my MacBook but I have no soft on my Mac mini. On my MacBook I have super Whisper. It feels like same with app you are talking about but there is no split. There is no splitting two speakers. There is just. Just the whole text of your speech not structured, just transcript, just transcriptions.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, I understand and I'm a bit surprised that Mac OS has different soft than MacBook. Is it? AM I. Am I understand you correctly?\n\nSpeaker B: That's two. No, that's two different devices. Now I'm working on Mac Mini and Sometimes I use MacBook to work on my bed.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, but you have different.\n\nSpeaker B: It's not one ecosystem. You can use the one the same cloud account but it is two different devices.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I understand. I suggest to. To not interrupt each other because it's hard to transcribe after our speaking for. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you. You can't download to Mac OS from Mac Mini from App Store Mac Whisper.\n\nSpeaker B: You mean it's not free? Mac Whisper is payment. Payment. It's. I think I checked it before and it looks like there's no free tariff. There is no free tariff.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, so maybe anyway we need only raw. Txt file so maybe I can record speakers. We agreed not interrupt each other Brother Splitting is called derisation in context of this kind of instrument. So the main problem for me it's several steps for transcribing. Currently I'm recording our. Our Conversation to voice recorder in my iPhone. Next step I share it with my saved Telegram account. After that I downloaded it to my developed by myself soft and after that I need to use some LLM and the problem is as I understand that the chat GPT or even Manus can't can't catch whole details from our our conversation and I'm not sure that our previous statistic is correct as you remember.\n\nSpeaker B: Did you try complexity for it?\n\nSpeaker A: Not yet, but maybe Gemini can be good because he takes much more bigger context. As I remember, you can try to.\n\nSpeaker B: Use Perplexity because it's really good in transcription. I think you just can try because Perplexity sometimes uses different Python and other libraries for some special tasks. So maybe a few days ago I tried to build a finance model for my idea with English clubs and Perplexity used Python labs to build some tables and some some graphics. So I think you can, you can just try to use Perplexity for it. Also you can change or if you have a subscription you can change different models inside the Perplexity and try to just try.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, but I. I think the main problem that any LLM used to make summary or something like that and if we need to analyze string by string we need to use API. So maybe it's. It will not be so hard to develop such kind of application.\n\nSpeaker B: We can try to use Granola maybe for it. Because if you ask Granola to transcribe the full transcription of our meeting with the splitting up two speakers, it may work.\n\nSpeaker A: Honestly, I tried to do it and I didn't find splitting our conversation by users. So you can see the splitting in window Granola window. But there is no indication who is one speaker and who is another. So it's one speaker is left or something like that wording on the left side and for the second user it's on the right side. So it's hard to understand who is where.\n\nSpeaker B: You can just try to try to use the context, not context window, just use the chat to catch persons. I will try to use Granola.\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, you can try because I have tried and I thought Granola has the full transcript, but it seems that it's not convenient for our purposes.\n\nSpeaker B: Why so?\n\nSpeaker A: Because as I said, there is no indication who is speaking.\n\nSpeaker B: Just, just. Okay, I will start Granola right now because sometimes you. You have to ask rewrite the transcription of this meeting using special labels for speaker one and speaker two for each phrase. For example, maybe it works. It will work. Maybe I will, I will check. You will check complexity. I Will check, you know.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, so. I suggest to keep this conversation 30 minutes for so we will have the same duration of our every conversation for tracking our metrics as we discussed last time.\n\nSpeaker B: I didn't understand what did you say?\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, I suggest to Keep this conversation 30 minutes duration for having comparative figures metrics as we discussed last time. So I transcribed our previous conversation. I will transcribe our current conversation and with the same prompt in Manus or Chat, GPT or Gemini and ask them to keep the same metric and track it every time for every conversation. But I would like to understand the logic of and I need an evidence that it the same logic every time and there is no summary from ChatGPT that well you have 15 mistakes or maybe 17 mistakes something like that.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Today I earned so next story. Today I earned 30,000 rubles of ref share from commission of agency fee from company which I used for delivery car for my former colleague. I mean we went to Rostov to take Audi CO3 for Kultiap after and before we agreed to take car by this company we agreed with them for revenue share and today it was completed in total amount, total amount of 30,000 rubles and as I understand the whole of their agency fee is about 100,000 rubles.\n\nSpeaker B: So so you now have money to eat something?\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, I, I, I'm trying to understand what, what, what I should I use. I forgotten I've remembered something like that. So the same scheme use uses Torbasov when he or it would be correct to say his agency uses agent for selling their properties. So and, and they have sometimes 15 refshre sometimes even more. It depends on amount of work they do. So it's a very interesting scheme if you good enough in marketing and you can give clients to company and have rev share. It seems quite, quite nice scheme.\n\nSpeaker B: You know in Gitmigit. Where Kate is working now there is a, there are some troubles with the capital, with money and also with salaries. So they want to earn some money in short period. So now they are using partnership, different partnerships. They are looking for sales or different roles to to sell their main product. Talent test. That's talent test. It's a product to, to test and to screen developers CVS to speed up the process of hiring. You know that's something like live coding but for skills. So they're trying to sell their product to different companies and they, they need a big big network wide network of sellers. So now they're acquiring the different roles for selling product. So Kate is responsible for the searching for the demos of product for them. And now they have same rev share model. But they they ready to pay about 50, 40 or 50% for sale. Per sale per contract. Yeah. So that's nothing special. I think that's popular model to sell something.\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, but for me quite interesting. How is usual CSC for instance, for this selling. Selling by buying company. So what is their usual cost of acquisition? Is it lower or bigger than 30,000 rubles or not? So maybe it's sometimes more efficient to push your marketing than share your revenue with agents. Maybe if they put advertising in Yandex Direct for instance, they understand okay, our CAC 10,000 troubles per client. So in this case, is it efficient to share your revenue with agent, for instance? Or it will be efficient to. To give this money to advertising Yandex Advertising.\n\nSpeaker B: I think there is one important thing it's a scheme is the resources. When you try to delegate your work to agent and the agent. If I understand the whole structure is correct, the agent is working. And that's agent's problem. How to find client and you. You're saving your resources inside the company. You can make any other useful things for your company. But if you acquire someone just by direct. By direct Direct, not direct. Using Yandex Direct, for example, you have to spend your your own resources. Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I think I understand. So you mean that if agent gave client to company, it will be much more warm client than from Yandex Direct, for instance. And you need put additional resources to this to client from Yandex Direct.\n\nSpeaker B: What does mean client for this company?\n\nSpeaker A: Client is a person who buy a car and gave them money for this car. And after that or in parallel in that they give for instance 100 rubles by agency commission to this client.\n\nSpeaker B: I don't know. Is it efficient or not?\n\nSpeaker A: Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: Is it effective or not?\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Thank you for. For consultation. Can I. Can I send you money?\n\nSpeaker B: I'm not so deep in this. In this business area, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker A: It's. I think it depends of agency scheme. Overall it's not depends on business, but. Okay, your opinion is very valuable for us. Thank you very much. Don't. For instance, interesting how the organization is working after pause. For instance, how a system is. Understand who is speaking right now? For instance, will I Speaker I Speaker B.\n\nSpeaker B: You. Are you asking me?\n\nSpeaker A: It's just my thought, but if you no answer. You can answer.\n\nSpeaker B: I don't know. But I suppose that. For the LLM, any. For any LLM, the voice is just combination of 0 and ones in the end. So I think the. Head of voice is working like as a parameter for LLM so I think that's it. So LLM just takes. A part of audio file and compare with the other part and I think it using it use uses something like method of sort and trying to catch the different speakers using different parameters for different speakers Maybe like this.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Can you turn your camera off on? I forgot what I would like to.\n\nSpeaker B: Tell you why why you use forgotten.\n\nSpeaker A: I I said I've forgotten I have forgotten that it means that I forgot it right now because one minute before I remembered it and during your speaking I have forgotten that person.\n\nSpeaker B: Is there a big difference between I.\n\nSpeaker A: Forgot.\n\nSpeaker B: And I have forgotten?\n\nSpeaker A: For me I have forgotten means I just forgot it like this and it for me it seems I I'm trying to keep my speech a little bit more native maybe and when I when I sure when I sure that I can use it correctly I try to use it. That's it.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, so what did you forget?\n\nSpeaker A: I forgot it.\n\nSpeaker B: When I talk to no by the way I really want to huh.\n\nSpeaker A: Maybe I I remember that I would like to say that this my application which I wipe coded it has derisation it has implied derisation and for our previous conversation it seems it works not bad so sometimes I I I saw their mistakes but overall if we are speaking about big part of my speech or your speech it works correctly as.\n\nSpeaker B: I do you use. I forgot the name of this LLM you use the same what I used for the bot not not 11 labs another one popular named the first letter.\n\nSpeaker A: Is a or E I don't remember honestly neat to use need to check which token I used but I don't remember it right now. Okay okay, so we have three minutes left so we can discuss some short theme.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah the last time I talked to one of my designer friends we can.\n\nSpeaker A: You can you speak Please strike through microphone because sometimes. Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. Yeah okay.\n\nSpeaker A: So.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah when when I talked to my designer friend we were discussing.\n\nSpeaker A: The.\n\nSpeaker B: English level to for working in international companies and the main idea from designer was that you have to worldwide teams prefer to work with non native speakers because it's really easy to understand Non native. Non native speakers are using simple words and try to describe hard things by simple words and it's important in product teams so that's the main idea.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. I think this approach is understandable and I think that it's always depends on. Person on the second side Is he a good international player? Is he understand that he is an international team because for instance, when we were working with our London teams, only one team person, which is C4 was good enough in pronunciation in he he kept this he kept his tone of voice quite slow and non emotional. So it was very easy to understand which is speaking and compare with him other team players. It was awful like Tasmanian diablo. It was disgusting sometimes so 10 seconds. You can congratulate your father with progressing logic on something with so I I will stop our record.",

Where Kate is working now there is a, there are some troubles with the capital, with money and also with salaries. So they want <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: to earn some money in a short period | The article 'a' is missing before 'short period.'\">to earn some money in short period</mark>. So now they are <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: using different partnerships | Repetitive and unnecessary use of 'partnership.'\">using partnership, different partnerships</mark>. They are looking for sales or different roles to to sell their main product. Talent test. That's talent test. It's a product to, to test and to screen developers CVS to speed up the process of hiring. You know that's something like live coding but for skills. So they're trying to sell their product to different companies and they, they need a big big network wide network of sellers. So now they're acquiring <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: different roles | The article 'the' is unnecessary.\">the different roles</mark> for selling product. So Kate is responsible for the searching for the demos of product for them. And now they have same rev share model. But <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: they are ready to pay | The verb 'are' is missing.\">they they ready to pay</mark> about 50, 40 or 50% for sale. Per sale per contract. Yeah. So that's nothing special. I think <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: that's a popular model | The article 'a' is necessary before 'popular model.'\">that's popular model</mark> to sell something.\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, but for <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: me, it is quite interesting | The phrase requires clarity and correct structure.\">me quite interesting</mark>. How is usual CSC for instance, for this selling. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: Selling by a buying company | Sentence is missing an article 'a' before 'buying company.'\">Selling by buying company</mark>. So what is their usual cost of acquisition? Is it lower or bigger than 30,000 rubles or not? So maybe it's sometimes more efficient to push your marketing than share your revenue with agents. Maybe if they put advertising in Yandex Direct for instance, they understand okay, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: our CAC is 10,000 rubles per client | Missing verb 'is' and incorrect unit; 'troubles' should be 'rubles.'\">our CAC 10,000 troubles per client</mark>. So in this case, is it efficient to share your revenue with agent, for instance? Or it will be efficient to. To give this money to advertising Yandex Advertising.\n\nSpeaker B: I think there is one important thing it's a scheme is the resources. When you try to delegate your work <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: to an agent, and if | Improper article use and punctuation. Needs a comma before 'if.'\">to agent and the agent. If</mark> I understand the whole structure is correct, the agent is working. And that's agent's problem. How to find client and you. You're saving your resources inside the company. You can make any other useful things for your company. But if you <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: acquire someone just by Direct, for example, | Repeated word and improper break. Needs 'for example' instead.\">acquire someone just by direct. By direct Direct,</mark> not direct. Using Yandex Direct, for example, you have to spend your your own resources. Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I think I understand. So you mean that if <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: agent gives a client to | Incorrect verb tense; should be present tense 'gives.'\">agent gave client to</mark> company, it will be much more warm client than from Yandex Direct, for instance. And you need put additional resources <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: to this client from | Unnecessary repetition of 'to.'\">to this to client from</mark> Yandex Direct.\n\nSpeaker B: What does mean client for this company?\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: A client is a person who buys a car | The sentence lacks an article before 'client.' The verb 'buy' should agree with the singular 'who' and be 'buys.'\">Client is a person who buy a car</mark> and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: gave the money for this car | The pronoun 'them' is incorrect because it implies multiple people, not the single previous noun 'client.' Use 'the' for specificity.\">gave them money for this car</mark>. And <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: after that or in parallel, they give | 'In parallel in that' is awkward and unclear. It should be revised to clarify the timing.\">after that or in parallel in that they give</mark> for instance <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: 100 rubles as an agency commission to this client | The phrase 'by agency commission' should be 'as an agency commission' to indicate the function of the money.\">100 rubles by agency commission to this client</mark>.\n\nSpeaker B: I don't know. Is it efficient or not?\n\nSpeaker A: Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: Is it effective or not?\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: Thank you for the consultation. | The definite article 'the' is needed before 'consultation' to specify the consultation.\">Thank you for. For consultation.</mark> Can I. Can I send you money?\n\nSpeaker B: I'm not so deep in this. In this business area, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker A: It's. I think <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: depends on the agency scheme | 'Depends of' should be 'depends on,' and 'agency scheme' should be preceded by 'the.'\">it depends of agency scheme</mark>. Overall <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: it does not depend on business | Incorrect form 'it's not depends' should be 'it does not depend.'\">it's not depends on business</mark>, but. Okay, your opinion is very valuable for us. Thank you very much. Don't. For instance, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: it's interesting how the organization works | Incomplete construction 'interesting how' needs to be 'it's interesting how,' and 'is working' should be 'works.'\">interesting how the organization is working</mark> after pause. For instance, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: how a system works. Do you understand who is speaking | Incomplete and confusing fragment corrected to form a complete sentence.\">how a system is. Understand who is speaking</mark> right now? For instance, will I Speaker I Speaker B.\n\nSpeaker B: You. Are you asking me?\n\nSpeaker A: It's just my thought, but <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: if you don't answer. You can answer. | 'No answer' should be 'don't answer' for correct negation.\">if you no answer. You can answer.</mark>\n\nSpeaker B: I don't know. But I suppose that. For the LLM, any. For any LLM, the voice <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: is just a combination of 0s and 1s | 'Combination of 0 and ones' should be 'a combination of 0s and 1s.'\">is just combination of 0 and ones</mark> in the end. So I think the. Head of voice is <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: working like a parameter | 'Like as' is incorrect, use 'like.'\">working like as a parameter</mark> for LLM so I think that's it. So LLM just takes. A part of audio file and compare with the other part and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I think it uses something | Incorrect forms 'it using it use uses' should be 'it uses.'\">I think it using it use uses something</mark> like method of sort and trying to catch the different speakers <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: distinguishing between different speakers using various parameters | Rephrase for clarity and correct usage.\">using different parameters for different speakers</mark> Maybe like this.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Can you turn your camera off on? I forgot what I would like to.\n\nSpeaker B: Tell you <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: why you used 'forgotten.' | Repetitive and incomplete; correct to 'used 'forgotten.''\">why why you use forgotten</mark>.\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I said I have forgotten that it means I forgot it right now | Repetitive use of 'I' is grammatically incorrect; should use 'I said I have forgotten'.\">I I said I've forgotten I have forgotten that it means that I forgot it right now</mark> because one minute before I remembered it and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: while you were speaking, I have forgotten | 'During your speaking' is awkward and incorrect; should be 'while you were speaking'.\">during your speaking I have forgotten</mark> that person.\n\nSpeaker B: Is there a big difference between I.\n\nSpeaker A: Forgot.\n\nSpeaker B: And I have forgotten?\n\nSpeaker A: For me I have forgotten means I just forgot it <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: like this, and for me it seems I am trying to | Unnecessary repetition of 'it' and 'I'. Also, a comma is needed.\">like this and it for me it seems I I'm trying to</mark> keep my speech a little bit more native maybe and when I when I sure <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: when I am sure that | Missing verb 'am' in 'I am sure'.\">when I sure that</mark> I can use it correctly I try to use it. That's it.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, so what did you forget?\n\nSpeaker A: I forgot it.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: When I talk to someone, by the way, I really want to. | Incomplete sentence and missing object for 'talk to'.\">When I talk to no by the way I really want to huh.</mark>\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: Maybe I remember that I would like to say this is my application | Repetition of 'I' and incorrect word order.\">Maybe I I remember that I would like to say that this my application</mark> which I wipe coded <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: it has a derivation, it has implied derivation | Spelling errors in 'derisation' (should be 'derivation').

It should be connected with 'that' to properly introduce the subordinate clause.\">to worldwide teams</mark> prefer to work with non native speakers because it's really easy to understand Non native. Non native speakers are using simple words and try to describe hard things by simple words and it's important in product teams so that's the main idea.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. I think this approach is understandable and I think that <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: it always depends on | The subject 'it' requires the verb 'depends' without 'is'.\">it's always depends on</mark>.
