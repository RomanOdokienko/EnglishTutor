  "transcript": "Speaker A: The last time we were talking with.\n\nSpeaker B: Daniel.\n\nSpeaker A: He was using the Chrome extension to transcribe his.\n\nSpeaker B: Speech.\n\nSpeaker A: Idiot.\n\nSpeaker B: Idiot.\n\nSpeaker A: Cat.\n\nSpeaker B: Anyway, I started it. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: So. So yeah, Daniel was. Was using the Chrome extension to transcribe his speech and to find some mistakes in. I don't know, maybe in pronunciation too, but mostly in. In using words so in dictionary.\n\nSpeaker B: So do you have this extension only for Google Meet.\n\nSpeaker A: It's working. Only for Google Meet. It works.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, we will check it later.\n\nSpeaker A: You can wipe code something for it just or local.\n\nSpeaker B: I think it's just needed to check. I hope some efficient instruments should have in place. And what is the difference between errors and mistakes in our context?\n\nSpeaker A: I used to see the errors in interface mostly so I can't explain what the difference between these words but in context I know that if you. If we're talking about. So I think maybe. Maybe mistakes that something you did and errors and something happened by itself. Maybe I don't.\n\nSpeaker B: Some more.\n\nSpeaker A: You know.\n\nSpeaker B: One more time please. Mistakes it what you can make and errors. It happens by itself. Okay, maybe. Okay. So do you have any English aim or purpose for this year? Maybe some. Maybe some level or some vocabulary on something like that? No.\n\nSpeaker A: No. There is no reason, no goals for it. We started to practice with. We started our practice with Dania at the end of November of last year just to. Just to. Just to practice because Dana is learning English in Germany. He needs the B1 or B2 level to work to find some work. And I thought at this moment I thought it would be nice to communicate more with Daniel sometimes and also practice English because our level D now is maybe similar just speaking level. Before eight years ago, I was more confident in my level. I speak more fluently. And now I think now I have some troubles. And also when I'm speaking with the international worldwide clients, sometimes it seems like a problem for me. So I just want to speak more fluent. So I started to practice and also I have an idea to create the local mini English speaking club for Russian designers. And maybe we can grow that's into something bigger. So that's useful for me and interesting to try.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. Have you ever visited any English community in Russia? Small talk groups online?\n\nSpeaker A: When I worked in Ray Peasant bank there was a bank, there was a local English club one time per sprint or per week, I can't recall. And it was really good because you can practice with the presentations and also you can practice in English. So you can choose the topic for the meeting and on the meeting you can prepare the presentation before the meeting. And you can describe your idea only with English. That was good.\n\nSpeaker B: And.\n\nSpeaker A: That'S it. That's. That's the one experience.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. I visited a couple of times when I came to Moscow. The first time in 2014 years. And it was like a game munchkin and one game, I don't remember how it's called. And I mostly was sitting like this and eating and as I remember everyone should order some meal. It was in restaurant and for me it was quite hard to order. Total amount 1000 rubles. So I just drinking a tea as I remember. So it wasn't very efficient for me I suppose because of my level was too low compared to other group. But currently I think it must be much more efficient.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. So I think the. For me it seems a little bit useless because when you play you can improve your playing English. So it's different. Yeah. So because when I was playing in Counter Strike when I was playing in Dota with the international mates. So it was useful for me and I thought my. At this time I thought my English is very nice because I can communicate with the other people from other countries. I played with people from Poland, from Europe, from usa, from China also. So I imagined. So I imagined that my English is nice. Yeah but I. But I needed to improve it. When I needed to improve my level for the visa interview, I was disappointed about my level. So the plain English is different from real real English. So also when we speak with Dania we use special design topics or industry topics IT topics to improve the professional English to know just to learn new words to try to speak more fluent. And also sometimes it seems easy because we already use some words in Russia like you know, the interface in Figma when we drawing we use words rectangle so we don't speak primovolnik we just use the rectangle or screen screenshot interface. That's Anglicism in Russia what we use.\n\nSpeaker B: Brother, I suggest to keep your answers a little bit shorter so we have a discussion because sometimes I feel a.\n\nSpeaker A: Little bit boring idea of my. My speeches. We have to prepare some topics, not just try to speak. We have to prepare topics. Startup topics maybe.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, sure. So I have a question how you understand your fluency level and second questions. How how you think we can evaluate our fluency level during the time. I have one idea. I can explain you, but maybe you have another one.\n\nSpeaker A: Repeat the first question.\n\nSpeaker B: First question, how we can evaluate our fluency level and progress of it.\n\nSpeaker A: And this is second question.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes.\n\nSpeaker A: What's the first one?\n\nSpeaker B: First one, how we can evaluate the currently our current fluency level and how you can understand that you have progress in it. Two questions.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I think, I think just for both situations we can use transcribe AI soft for it. For example we can, we can set up. It's hard, it's hard to explain. We can use transcribe AI soft to see how much words we can speak through the 30 minutes for example. So we can start it just then transcribe and.\n\nSpeaker B: Compare. Compare.\n\nSpeaker A: So we can compare the amount of text.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes, agree. I have the same idea. And the second metric can be the total amount of mistakes in this volume of text. So then higher your volume of text and lower your level of mistakes. So then higher your fluence level. I suppose.\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so.\n\nSpeaker B: Because.\n\nSpeaker A: Quantity of mistakes. So big quantity of mistakes doesn't mean that you speak slow. You can make mistakes, but you can speak fluently.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. But anyway if you increase your level of text of words and you have the same amount of mistakes so it means that you your speech is more fluent, it's higher, it's higher temp. So because I just. Because just I would like to turn one and half or maybe two speed up and when I listening and I also would like to speed up my own speech when I speaking.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah. I don't like the sounds between the words. So now I think now.\n\nSpeaker B: I have.\n\nSpeaker A: Some troubles in pronunciation and also I have some troubles with thinking because when your English is fluent you can speak. You can just speak. But now when I'm speaking before I have to think and then I have to speak.\n\nSpeaker B: Do you need Russian?\n\nSpeaker A: Then translate and then speak. So that's a big problem for me. And that's because no practice.\n\nSpeaker B: So when you went to America last time, did you have the same problem or you have lack of it after one, two, three months there?\n\nSpeaker A: I fixed this after maybe two weeks in America because when you're working in English speaking area, I don't know the how to translate another way. Not area environment. Yeah. So when you, when you work in English speaking environment with English speaking people, you have to. You have to be adaptive.\n\nSpeaker B: So okay, yeah, I fixed it. And one, one hit. Not hit how it would be one life hack that I came take from my lesson. My English teacher, he said that you need you. He means me myself. He said that you need to explain English words in English words. So you shouldn't say sridha. You have to explain to me this word. So I need to understand and suggest you ways to pronounce it to say.\n\nSpeaker A: That yeah, yeah, yeah, that's. That's good advice. So I used. I used the same advice for Dania when we were speaking.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah. And it was interesting. That exists English vocabulary to explain such kind of words. Any words in English. It's quite strange, but it's like a big Russian vocabulary of dal or ov. So Russian boards explained by Russian boards. By the way, are you going to take English tutor during this year?\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so. I have two or three already paid paid lessons on platform.\n\nSpeaker B: Me too, by the way. Me too. I have maybe $100 of deposit if it's still available for me. I don't know, maybe even 500. 500 deposit in my Italki account. I remember I credited my account because of. It was maybe in 2022 year when credit cards or debit cards should be closed. If I'm not mistaken.\n\nSpeaker A: When I was applying to I can't recall the name of company from Portugal.\n\nSpeaker B: Can't recall. Can't recall. You said can't recall?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, recall, recall. So you try to. Just like you remember, you know the remember word. You know, remember.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: So do you know what does mean recall?\n\nSpeaker B: Yes. Recall means when you call back your message or something like that.\n\nSpeaker A: No, no. Recall in your mind that you try to. To find something in your mind and you find it when you find you recall. If you can't find something in your head, you can't recall. So something happened a few time ago, a few years ago and you try to recall it.\n\nSpeaker B: So can you. Can you say your sentence one more time again fully?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I can't recall the name of company. I can't recall the name of company.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. It means that you can't in 2023. So you. You forgot it.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I forgot and I can't recall.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I understand.\n\nSpeaker A: So what I was talking about. Yeah, I was trying to. To be a part of Portugal company usp and I bought maybe five or six lessons on Russian platform to prepare for interview. So like. Like it was special, not special course, special lessons from the, from the teacher. So I have two or three more lessons on my account, but I didn't use it. I don't use. Maybe. Maybe I have to use it if it's alive, still alive, but we'll see. So I. I don't have any special purpose for this year. So I don't know my need. Need to. To use teacher for it.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. I hope my $500 are still alive. So I had a question. Okay. So do you have some special thing for today or I can also. Or I can suggest.\n\nSpeaker A: You can suggest. I don't have.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, I can't.\n\nSpeaker A: But I can't go to perplexity. I had some topics we discussed with Dania and I have some empty.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, we can discuss today's. Today's pitch for Hartman. As you remember, one time per month he visited such kind of.\n\nSpeaker A: Pitches. And that's not discussion, that's just.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I can. I can. I can tell you what came to my attention today's. No one was succeeded to invest only one team with Agrillo Apollo which is Skolkow residence. And who did investors service. Hartman said that he's ready to keep in touch in some way. And interesting was his mention about churn of lovable. He said that churn's low able is about 19% for me it was quite strange figures. I google it and find nothing about such disaster figures. So maybe he knows something that I don't know. But maybe he missed something or. Or it's incorrect information or something. So what else interesting? This Vladimir Pankhose who is making startups with glasses. Yes. He said that revenue from 1.1 store in his firm is about. From 4 till 10 million rubles. I don't remember. Was it about revenue or. Or net profit? I suppose it's revenue, but he said that it's from three to five times higher than usual optic stores. And it's quite interesting because I. I don't remember. Did I. Did I send you photos of their clubs? Optic clubs?\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so. Maybe just the slide from presentation.\n\nSpeaker B: Oh, by the way, you can check it in love.comor.\n\nSpeaker A: True.\n\nSpeaker B: So it's quite interesting. I don't remember where he's working. He. He said he's from Yakutia or some north region. And as I'm if I'm not mistaken, they have five or seven.\n\nSpeaker A: I see the pictures.\n\nSpeaker B: What.\n\nSpeaker A: What does it mean?\n\nSpeaker B: Clubs collapse means store.\n\nSpeaker A: Conception. This is a part of conception.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes. And it's interesting to understand too in which cities they are represented. Yeah, he's. Their company is registered in Yakutsk.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah. There is a five. Oh no, five. Not five. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Seven addresses.\n\nSpeaker B: Seven. Yes. So let me check the revenue of their company. Official revenue. Interesting. 100 million rubles and net profit is. Net loss for 40 million rubles.\n\nSpeaker A: 40 million for the last year.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes, for the previous year. Interesting. So it's interesting that for some quite special type of business. Maybe not type of business, but style of this kind of business, they have Solid revenue for your Kusk. Just interesting case like maybe like Chico as you remember Chico is Korean store. Korean food store. Yep so what interesting today was else. So Glasses Ah it was Glasses it was investment service Third service was about. Content Content maker Content factory. Content factory. Yes they they have a lot of phones registered in Kazakhstan and maybe something like that and they they concept they are not generate UCG content mostly they distributed it from their customers their clients so their suggestion is too efficient way to distribute content that already created and.\n\nSpeaker A: Hartman said looks looks same with the idea I was talking about today named Buffer the social media planner.\n\nSpeaker B: If I understand correctly the idea of Buffer the Buffer it's when you just. It's just about timing or distribution through different platform. Yes yes but but main idea of service which was presented to Hartman is to boost such kind of content.\n\nSpeaker A: So.\n\nSpeaker B: They they guaranteed for instance rates 100 ruples per 1000 views so it's not. You can. If you use Buffer you can post your content in 100 social medias but it can be not viewed at all and this company guaranteed that it will be boosted or distributed and you will have some how I would say views.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I got it.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes.\n\nSpeaker A: Each rich or what?\n\nSpeaker B: Yes okay and what else Java I was not interested in it but the mostly interested theme in this project was a founder it was a quite young girl and she. She. She take about 500 meetings per month during a month maybe it was only one month and her conversion her conversion rate to sale was about 20% and it was impressive. Yes it impressed Hartmont as well and he said you don't need to raise money just go through couple of months in this temp what is the synonym of temp? I'm not sure the temp is the right what here Pace maybe pace same speed speed or pace base it's like and so it's it's for project and was five. Don't remember. So just ah. Where is Vasily Vlebnikov is investor what is the project? It's what's about Glasses that's it I suppose 55 proof 5th project is not going to mention we have 31 minutes I suggest to stop because it's quite so so it's one slot during which we can evaluate our metrics I can make a Google Doc and we will put this our metrics in every time and one concern that I have that AI will be good enough in determination of determine if determine in definition of mistakes in correct way. Let's.\n\nSpeaker A: Let's check we have to check some tools. So we can try to use maybe different tools. For example, we can use for the transcribation, we can use something like Super Whisper or Fathom or something like that for the full transcribe meeting. And also we can use Google extension to check mistakes. And it will be like the combination of tools but we have to use Google Meet this way.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, let's try. So that's it for this time?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: In bye bye Brand.",

Just to practice because Dana is learning English in Germany. He needs the B1 or B2 level to work to find some work. And I thought at this moment I thought it would be nice to communicate more with Daniel sometimes and also practice English because our level D now is maybe similar just speaking level. Before eight years ago, I was more confident in my level. I speak more fluently. And now I think now I have some troubles. And also when I'm speaking with the international worldwide clients, sometimes it seems like a problem for me. So I just want to speak more fluent. So I started to practice and also I have an idea to create the local mini English speaking club for Russian designers. And maybe we can grow that's into something bigger. So that's useful for me and interesting to try.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. Have you ever visited any English community in Russia? Small talk groups online?\n\nSpeaker A: When I worked in Ray Peasant bank there was a bank, there was a local English club one time per sprint or per week, I can't recall. And it was really good because you can practice with the presentations and also you can practice in English. So you can choose the topic for the meeting and on the meeting you can prepare the presentation before the meeting. And you can describe your idea only with English. That was good.\n\nSpeaker B: And.\n\nSpeaker A: That'S it. That's. That's the one experience.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. I visited a couple of times when I came to Moscow. The first time in 2014 years. And it was like a game munchkin and one game, I don't remember how it's called. And I mostly was sitting like this and eating and as I remember everyone should order some meal. It was in restaurant and for me it was quite hard to order. Total amount 1000 rubles. So I just drinking a tea as I remember. So it wasn't very efficient for me I suppose because of my level was too low compared to other group. But currently I think it must be much more efficient.\n",

So because when I was playing in Counter Strike when I was playing in Dota with the international mates. So it was useful for me and I thought my. At this time I thought my English is very nice because I can communicate with the other people from other countries. I played with people from Poland, from Europe, from usa, from China also. So I imagined. So I imagined that my English is nice. Yeah but I. But I needed to improve it. When I needed to improve my level for the visa interview, I was disappointed about my level. So the plain English is different from real real English. So also when we speak with Dania we use special design topics or industry topics IT topics to improve the professional English to know just to learn new words to try to speak more fluent. And also sometimes it seems easy because we already use some words in Russia like you know, the interface in Figma when we drawing we use words rectangle so we don't speak primovolnik we just use the rectangle or screen screenshot interface. That's Anglicism in Russia what we use.\n\nSpeaker B: Brother, I suggest to keep your answers a little bit shorter so we have a discussion because sometimes I feel a.\n\nSpeaker A: Little bit boring idea of my. My speeches. We have to prepare some topics, not just try to speak. We have to prepare topics. Startup topics maybe.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, sure. So I have a question how you understand your fluency level and second questions. How how you think we can evaluate our fluency level during the time. I have one idea. I can explain you, but maybe you have another one.\n\nSpeaker A: Repeat the first question.\n\nSpeaker B: First question, how we can evaluate our fluency level and progress of it.\n",

I suppose.\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so.\n\nSpeaker B: Because.\n\nSpeaker A: Quantity of mistakes. So big quantity of mistakes doesn't mean that you speak slow.

So maybe he knows something that I don't know. But maybe he missed something or. Or it's incorrect information or something. So what else interesting? This Vladimir Pankhose who is making startups with glasses. Yes. He said that revenue from 1.1 store in his firm is about. From 4 till 10 million rubles. I don't remember. Was it about revenue or. Or net profit? I suppose it's revenue, but he said that it's from three to five times higher than usual optic stores. And it's quite interesting because I. I don't remember. Did I. Did I send you photos of their clubs? Optic clubs?\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so. Maybe just the slide from presentation.\n\nSpeaker B: Oh, by the way, you can check it in love.comor.\n\nSpeaker A: True.\n\nSpeaker B: So it's quite interesting. I don't remember where he's working. He. He said he's from Yakutia or some north region. And as I'm if I'm not mistaken, they have five or seven.\n",

Official revenue. Interesting. 100 million rubles and net profit is. Net loss for 40 million rubles.\n\nSpeaker A: 40 million for the last year.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes, for the previous year. Interesting. So it's interesting that for some quite special type of business. Maybe not type of business, but style of this kind of business, they have Solid revenue for your Kusk. Just interesting case like maybe like Chico as you remember Chico is Korean store. Korean food store. Yep so what interesting today was else. So Glasses Ah it was Glasses it was investment service Third service was about. Content Content maker Content factory. Content factory. Yes they they have a lot of phones registered in Kazakhstan and maybe something like that and they they concept they are not generate UCG content mostly they distributed it from their customers their clients so their suggestion is too efficient way to distribute content that already created and.\n\nSpeaker A: Hartman said looks looks same with the idea I was talking about today named Buffer the social media planner.\n\nSpeaker B: If I understand correctly the idea of Buffer the Buffer it's when you just. It's just about timing or distribution through different platform. Yes yes but but main idea of service which was presented to Hartman is to boost such kind of content.\n",

She. She take about 500 meetings per month during a month maybe it was only one month and her conversion her conversion rate to sale was about 20% and it was impressive. Yes it impressed Hartmont as well and he said you don't need to raise money just go through couple of months in this temp what is the synonym of temp? I'm not sure the temp is the right what here Pace maybe pace same speed speed or pace base it's like and so it's it's for project and was five. Don't remember. So just ah. Where is Vasily Vlebnikov is investor what is the project? It's what's about Glasses that's it I suppose 55 proof 5th project is not going to mention we have 31 minutes I suggest to stop because it's quite so so it's one slot during which we can evaluate our metrics I can make a Google Doc and we will put this our metrics in every time and one concern that I have that AI will be good enough in determination of determine if determine in definition of mistakes in correct way.

So also when we speak with Dania we use special design topics or industry topics IT topics to improve the professional English to know just to learn new words <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: to try to speak more fluently. | 'Fluently' is the correct adverb form.\">to try to speak more fluent.</mark> And also sometimes it seems easy because we already use some words in Russia <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: a little bit bored with my speeches. | Corrects the phrase to reflect the speaker's intended meaning.\">like you know, the interface in Figma when</mark> we drawing we use words rectangle so we don't speak primovolnik we just use the rectangle or screen screenshot interface. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: That's an Anglicism we use in Russia. | Corrects the sentence structure for clarity.\">That's Anglicism in Russia what we use.</mark>\n\nSpeaker B: Brother, I suggest to keep your answers a little bit shorter so we have a discussion because sometimes I feel a.\n\nSpeaker A: Little bit boring idea of my. My speeches. We have to prepare some topics, not just try to speak. We have to prepare topics. Startup topics maybe.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, sure. So I have a question how you understand your fluency level and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: second question. How do you think | 'Questions' should be singular; 'how' should be followed by 'do you think' for correct question format.\">second questions. How how you think</mark> we can evaluate our fluency level during the time. I have one idea. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: I can explain to you, but maybe | 'Explain to you' is the correct verb phrase.\">I can explain you, but maybe</mark> you have another one.\n\nSpeaker A: Repeat the first question.\n\nSpeaker B: First question, how we can evaluate our fluency level and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: progress of our fluency level. | Clarifies the object of progress.\">progress of it.</mark>\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: And this is the second question. | The article 'the' is needed before the ordinal 'second' to specify it.\">And this is second question.</mark>\n\nSpeaker B: Yes.\n\nSpeaker A: What's the first one?\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: First, how we can evaluate our current fluency level | 'Currently' is redundant and disrupts sentence flow; removing it clarifies meaning.\">First one, how we can evaluate the currently our current fluency level</mark> <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: and how you can understand whether you have made progress in it. | 'Have progress' should be 'have made progress' to correctly indicate an accomplishment.\">and how you can understand that you have progress in it.</mark> Two questions.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I think, I think just for both <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: we can use Transcribe AI software to see how many words | 'How much words' should be 'how many words' as words are countable. 'Transcribe AI soft' capitalization is also corrected.\">situations we can use transcribe AI soft for it. For example</mark> we can, we can set up. It's hard, it's hard to explain. We can use transcribe AI soft to see how much words we can speak through the 30 minutes for example. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: So we can start it and then transcribe. | The phrase is unclear and needs restructuring for correct sequence of actions.\">So we can start it just then transcribe and.</mark>\n\nSpeaker B: Compare. Compare.\n\nSpeaker A: So we can compare the amount of text.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: Yes, I agree. | The verb 'agree' should be preceded by a subject.\">Yes, agree.</mark> I have the same idea. And the second metric can be the total amount of mistakes in this volume of text. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: The higher your volume of text, the lower your level of mistakes. | Incorrect use of comparative 'higher' and 'lower' without article 'the' or conjunction.\">So then higher your volume of text and lower your level of mistakes.</mark> <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: The higher your fluency level. | Incorrect comparative structure and use of 'fluence' instead of 'fluency'.\">So then higher your fluence level.</mark> I suppose.\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so.\n\nSpeaker B: Because.\n\nSpeaker A: Quantity of mistakes. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: A large quantity of mistakes doesn’t mean | Incorrect use of 'so big' should be 'a large' for quantity.\">So big quantity of mistakes doesn't mean</mark> that you speak slow. You can make mistakes, but you can speak fluently.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. But anyway if you increase your level of text of words and you have the same amount of mistakes so it means that you your speech is more fluent, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: it's a higher tempo. | 'Temp' is incorrect; 'tempo' is the correct term.\">it's higher, it's higher temp.</mark> So because I just. Because just I would like to turn one and half or maybe two speed up and when <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: I am listening | Incorrect verb form; should be present continuous tense.\">I listening</mark> and I also would like to speed up my own speech when <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: I am speaking. | Incorrect verb form; should be present continuous tense.\">I speaking.</mark>\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah. I don't like the <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: I think now. | Repetition of 'now' is redundant and should be removed.\">sounds between the</mark> words. So now I think now.\n\nSpeaker B: I have.\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Some trouble with | 'Trouble' is usually uncountable and takes 'with'.\">Some troubles in</mark> pronunciation and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I also have trouble with | Use 'trouble' instead of 'troubles' and place 'also' correctly.\">also I have some troubles with</mark> thinking because when your English is fluent you can speak. You can just speak. But <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: now before I speak, I have to think | The phrase should be reordered for clarity and tense consistency.\">now when I'm speaking before I have to think</mark> and then I have to speak.\n\nSpeaker B: Do you need Russian?\n\nSpeaker A: Then translate and then speak. So that's a big problem for me. And that's <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: because I have no practice. | Subject 'I' and auxiliary verb 'have' are missing.\">because no practice.</mark>\n\nSpeaker B: So when you went to America last time, did you have the same problem <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: or did you | The phrase should have parallel tense structure with 'did' for past actions.\">or you</mark> <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: experience a lack of it | 'Lack' as a noun should be paired with 'experience' to denote shortage.\">have lack of it</mark> after one, two, three months there?\n\nSpeaker A: I fixed this after maybe two weeks in America because <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: when you're working in an English-speaking area | An article 'an' is needed before a singular, unspecified, countable noun, and 'English-speaking' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective.\">when you're working in English speaking area</mark>, I don't know the how to translate another way. Not area environment. Yeah. So when <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: came to take from | The verb 'come' should be in past tense to match 'came', and 'to' is needed for infinitive form.\">you, when you work</mark> in English speaking environment with English speaking people, you have to. You have to be adaptive.\n\nSpeaker B: So okay, yeah, I fixed it. And one, one hit. Not hit how it would be one life hack that I came take from my lesson. My English teacher, he said that you need you. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: He meant me myself. | The verb should be in past tense to maintain consistency.\">He means me myself.</mark> He said that you need to explain English words in English words. So you shouldn't say sridha. You have to explain to me this word. So I need to understand and suggest you ways to pronounce it to say.\n\nSpeaker A: That yeah, yeah, yeah, that's. That's good advice. So I used. I used the same advice for Dania when we were speaking.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah. And it was interesting. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: There exists English vocabulary | The existential phrase 'there exists' is needed instead of 'that exists'.\">That exists English vocabulary</mark> to explain <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: such kinds of words | 'Kinds' should be plural after 'such'.\">such kind of words</mark>. Any words in English. It's quite strange, but it's like a big Russian vocabulary of dal or ov. So <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Russian words | Logical error; 'boards' should be 'words' to match the context.\">Russian boards</mark> explained by Russian boards. By the way, are you going to <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: take English tutoring during this year | The noun form 'tutoring' is required instead of 'tutor'.\">take English tutor during this year</mark>?\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so. I have two or three already <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: paid lessons on a platform | Repetition and missing article error; only one 'paid' is needed, and 'a' is needed before 'platform'.\">paid paid lessons on platform</mark>.\n\nSpeaker B: Me too, by the way. Me too. I have maybe $100 of deposit if it's still available for me. I don't know, maybe even 500. 500 deposit in my Italki account. I remember I credited my account because of. It was maybe <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"PREP: Correct: in the year 2022 | The prepositional phrase should include 'the year' correctly.\">in 2022 year</mark> when credit cards or debit cards should be closed. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: If I am not mistaken. | Avoid contractions for formal clarity.\">If I'm not mistaken.</mark>\n\nSpeaker A: When I was applying to I can'<mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: the name of the company from | The article 'the' is needed before 'company' to specify which company is being referred to.\">t recall the name of company from</mark> Portugal.\n\nSpeaker B: Can't recall. Can't recall. You said can't recall?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, recall, recall. So you try to. Just like you remember, you know the remember word. You know, remember.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: So do you know <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: what recall means | The correct word order in indirect questions is 'what + subject + verb.'\">what does mean recall</mark>?\n\nSpeaker B: Yes. Recall means when you call back your message or something like that.\n\nSpeaker A: No, no. Recall in your mind that you try to. To find something in your mind and you find it when you find you recall. If you can't find something in your head, you can't recall. So something happened <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: a few times | 'Time' should be plural when referring to multiple instances.\">a few time</mark> ago, a few years ago and you try to recall it.\n\nSpeaker B: So can you. Can you say your sentence one more time again fully?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I can't recall the <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: name of the company | 'The' is needed before singular, specific nouns.\">name of company</mark>. I can't recall the name of company.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. It means that you can't in 2023. So you. You forgot it.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I forgot and I can't recall.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I understand.\n\nSpeaker A: So what I was talking about. Yeah, I was trying to. To be <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: a part of a Portuguese company | A determiner is needed and &quot;Portuguese&quot; is the correct adjective form for something related to Portugal.\">a part of Portugal company</mark> usp and I bought maybe five or six lessons <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: on a Russian platform | A determiner is needed before &quot;Russian platform.&quot;\">on Russian platform</mark> to prepare for interview. So like. Like it was special, not special course, special lessons from the, from the teacher. So I have two or three more lessons on my account, but I didn't use it. I don't use. Maybe. Maybe I have to use it if it's alive, still alive, but we'll see. So I. I don't have any special purpose for this year. So I don't know my need. Need to. To use teacher for it.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. I hope <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: my $500 is | Amounts of money are usually treated as singular.\">my $500 are</mark> still alive. So I had a question. Okay. So do you have <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: something special | &quot;Something special&quot; is the correct expression.\">some special thing</mark> for today or I can also. Or I can suggest.\n\nSpeaker A: You can suggest. I don't have.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, I can't.\n\nSpeaker A: But I can't go to perplexity. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ORDER: Correct: I had some topics to discuss | The sentence structure is incorrect for expressing intended discussion.\">I had some topics we discussed</mark> with Dania and I have some empty.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, we can discuss today's. Today's pitch for Hartman. As you remember, one time per month he visited <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: this kind of | The correct expression is &quot;this kind of.&quot;\">such kind of</mark>.\n\nSpeaker A: Pitches. And that's not discussion, that's just.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I can. I can. I can tell you <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: what came to my attention today | The possessive form 'today's' is incorrect in this context; 'today' should be used instead.\">what came to my attention today's</mark>. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: No one succeeded in investing | The phrase 'was succeeded to invest' is incorrect; it should be 'succeeded in investing'.\">No one was succeeded to invest</mark> only one team with Agrillo Apollo which is Skolkow residence. And <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: who provided investor services | The phrase 'did investors service' is awkward; it should be 'provided investor services'.\">who did investors service</mark>. Hartman said that he's ready to keep in touch in some way. And interesting was his mention about churn of lovable. He said that <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: churn rate is about 19% | The phrase 'churn's low able' is incorrect; it should be 'churn rate'.\">churn's low able is about 19%</mark> for me it was quite strange figures. I google it and find nothing about such <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: disastrous figures | 'Disaster' needs to be changed to 'disastrous' to form the correct adjective.\">disaster figures</mark>. So maybe he knows something that I don't know. But maybe he missed something or. Or it's incorrect information or something. So what else interesting? This Vladimir Pankhose who is <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: creating startups involving glasses | The phrase 'making startups with glasses' is awkward; 'creating startups involving glasses' is clearer.\">making startups with glasses</mark>. Yes. He said that revenue from 1.1 store in his firm is about. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: From 4 to 10 million rubles | The word 'till' is informal; 'to' is preferred in this context.\">From 4 till 10 million rubles</mark>. I don't remember. Was it about revenue or. Or net profit? I suppose it's revenue, but he said that it's from <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: three to five times that of | The phrase 'times higher than' is incorrect; it should be 'times that of'.\">three to five times higher than</mark> usual optic stores. And it's quite interesting because I. I don't remember. Did I. Did I send you photos of their clubs? Optic clubs?\n\nSpeaker A: I don't think so. Maybe just the slide from presentation.\n\nSpeaker B: Oh, by the way, you can check it <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: on love.com | 'In love.comor' is incorrect; the correct phrase is 'on love.com'.\">in love.comor</mark>.\n\nSpeaker A: True.\n\nSpeaker B: So it's quite interesting. I don't remember where he's working. He. He said he's from Yakutia or <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: some northern region | 'North' should be 'northern' for correct adjectival form.\">some north region</mark>. And as I'm if I'm not mistaken, they have five or seven.\n\nSpeaker A: I see the pictures.\n\nSpeaker B: What.\n\nSpeaker A: What does it mean?\n\nSpeaker B: Clubs collapse means store.\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: This is part of a concept. | Repeating 'conception' is redundant and 'concept' is more appropriate here.\">Conception. This is a part of conception.</mark>\n\nSpeaker B: Yes. And it's interesting to understand too in which cities they are represented. Yeah, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: they are. | Pronoun agreement issue; 'he's' should be replaced with 'they are'.\">he's. Their</mark> company is registered in Yakutsk.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah. There <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: are five | 'Five' is plural, so it should be preceded by 'are' instead of 'is'.\">is a five</mark>. Oh no, five. Not five. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Seven addresses.\n\nSpeaker B: Seven. Yes. So let me check the revenue of their company. Official revenue. Interesting. 100 million rubles and net profit is. Net loss for 40 million rubles.\n\nSpeaker A: 40 million for the last year.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes, for the previous year. Interesting. So it's interesting that for some quite special type of business. Maybe not type of business, but style of this kind of business, they have Solid revenue for your Kusk. Just interesting case like maybe like Chico as you remember Chico is Korean store. Korean food store. Yep so <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: what else was interesting today | The correct order for the interrogative structure is needed.\">what interesting today was else</mark>. So Glasses Ah it was Glasses it was investment service Third service was about. Content Content maker Content factory. Content factory. Yes they they have a lot of phones registered in Kazakhstan and maybe something like that and they they concept <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"VERB: Correct: they do not generate UGC content | Improper verb form and abbreviation. 'Are' should be 'do,' and 'UCG' should be 'UGC' (User-Generated Content).\">they are not generate UCG content</mark> mostly they distributed it from their customers their clients so their suggestion is too efficient way to distribute content that already created and.\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Hartman said looks the same as | Correct idiomatic expression is 'looks the same as'.\">Hartman said looks looks same with</mark> the idea I was talking about today named Buffer the social media planner.\n\nSpeaker B: If I understand correctly the idea of Buffer <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Buffer is when you | Extraneous use of 'the' and contraction is not needed.\">the Buffer it's when you</mark> just. It's just about timing or distribution <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: through different platforms | 'Platform' should be plural to match 'different'.\">through different platform</mark>. Yes yes <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: but the main idea of the service which | Missing articles 'the' before 'main idea' and 'service'.\">but but main idea of service which</mark> was presented to Hartman is to boost such kind of content.\n\nSpeaker A: So.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: They guaranteed, for instance, | The word 'They' is repeated unnecessarily and commas are needed for clarity.\">They they guaranteed for instance</mark> rates 100 ruples per 1000 views so it's not. You can. If you use Buffer you can post your content in 100 social medias <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: but it might not be viewed at all | Incorrect phrase structure; 'might not be' is the correct form.\">but it can be not viewed at all</mark> and this <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: company guarantees that it will be | Tense consistency needs to be maintained; 'guarantees' is the correct form here.\">company guaranteed that it will be</mark> boosted or distributed <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: and you will have, somehow, what I would call views | Incorrect use of 'somehow'; commas needed for clarity.\">and you will have some how I would say views</mark>.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I got it.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes.\n\nSpeaker A: Each rich or what?\n\nSpeaker B: Yes okay and what else Java I was not interested in it but the mostly interested <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: theme in this project was the founder | Incorrect article usage; 'the' specifies the noun.\">theme in this project was a founder</mark> it was a quite young girl and she.

Yes it impressed Hartmont as well and he said you don't need to raise money <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: just go through a couple of months | Missing article 'a' is needed before 'couple'.\">just go through couple of months</mark> <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: at this pace | Incorrect word choice; 'temp' should be 'pace.'\">in this temp</mark> what is the synonym of temp? I'm not sure the temp is the right what here Pace maybe pace same speed speed or pace base it's like and so it's it's for project and was five. Don't remember. So just ah. Where is Vasily Vlebnikov is investor what is the project? It's what's about Glasses that's it I suppose 55 proof 5th project is not going to mention we have 31 minutes I suggest to stop because it's quite so so it's one slot during which we can evaluate our metrics I can make a Google Doc and we will put this our metrics in every time and one concern that I have that AI will be good enough in <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"WORD: Correct: determining if the definition | Redundant and incorrect phrasing; clarity is needed.\">determination of determine if determine in definition</mark> of mistakes <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"ARTICLE: Correct: in a correct way | An article is needed before 'correct way.'\">in correct way</mark>. Let's.\n\nSpeaker A: Let's check we have to check some tools. So we can try to use maybe different tools. For example, we can use for the transcribation, we can use something like Super Whisper or Fathom or something like that for the full <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"TENSE: Correct: transcribed meeting | 'Transcribe' should be in past participle form 'transcribed' to modify 'meeting.'\">transcribe meeting</mark>. And also we can use Google extension to check mistakes. And it will be like the combination of tools but we have to use Google Meet this way.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, let's try. So that's it for this time?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Goodbye | 'In bye bye' is incorrect.
