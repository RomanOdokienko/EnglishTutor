  "transcript": "Speaker A: So I started recording I'm Roman. And I would like to hear your experience with your group of designers who are going to improve their English in your group.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay. I'm Andre. Every time when you say I'm Roman, it's a bit strange. You're not Roman, you're not Romanian, you're Roman. Okay. Yesterday was a pilot meeting of my English speaking clubs. And. It was six people including me and Kate. They were from design industry or almost design industry. So one girl from UX writing and three designers, different levels like seniors to design head. I started meeting at 9pm so they were working the whole day and then we were speaking. And I think that's the reason why it was not too fast as I wanted, but it was good enough for the pilot meeting. We were talking about dark patterns and ethics in design. I sent the topic before the meeting. So I sent it in the morning and they had enough time to prepare for. Was hard a bit to facilitate this meeting because sometimes I. Didn't understand some words or some sense from them. And it was hard to play ping pong with words. Just when I was trying to facilitate this meeting. I wanted to ask questions for their replies. For example, I answered the question, they reply and I answer again to build the dialogue. And it was hard a bit. But the good things I can say that I tried to. To involve people for the conversation to the conversation. I just. Sometimes when I saw someone is silent or too quiet. I tried to answer the questions or just picked someone to answer for my question. And it was a good thing I did. The whole meeting was about one hour, a bit less maybe. Also I get some feedback from people. I asked the. Honest, honest feedback and some participants gave me positive feedback, some negative things.\n\nSpeaker A: And now I don't know.\n\nSpeaker B: I just need to aggregate the whole the feedback from all of participants and analyze it with complexity and give it the full. Give it full context and try to improve something. Maybe I will try to. Acquire some people from my channel for the next meetings. We'll see. So I think it was good enough for the pilot.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, interesting. And how did you feel? Is it. Good amount of people for one hour? Or it was too much or. Or it's six. Six people.\n\nSpeaker B: I think that's my hypothesis. So I think it will be better to think shorter for minutes and I think for 40 minutes it will be bad.\n\nSpeaker A: Could you please stop? I'm frozen. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: Some legs.\n\nSpeaker A: Could you please stop? I'm frozen. I hear nothing from your last paragraph from beginning. I mean I. I didn't Hear any part of your answer for my question. Could you please repeat?\n\nSpeaker B: I will. I will repeat for you.\n\nSpeaker A: And one more interruption please. Could you please speak straightforward to your microphone and please do not take like this one.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: I just try to find some words on my wall.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I understand.\n\nSpeaker B: Yes. So my. I have a hypothesis that it will be better to decrease minutes for the meeting, for example 40 minutes. And I think I have to invite four people for 40 minutes because of me. In this way meeting will be more dynamic. Dynamical, I don't know. So yeah, I will try to. To do this to do it. And also I want to include a presentation for the meeting or Figma board or Miraboard just because it's more interesting to interact during the meeting.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. And what do you have any strategy on this project or. Or what is the hypothesis for it?\n\nSpeaker B: Overall? I think I have a hypothesis for the whole project that I can acquire 50 people during six months. If I can do this, I can scale up the whole project because if I acquire 50 people, it's enough people. It's enough people on the market for the growing up to grow up. This, this project just. I can use the same way to acquire people as first 50 users. And then I can transform the offer from just speaking clubs to preparing for interviews. Also I can add mock interviews as individual service for some participants of club. And. We can. We can try. Bruce, are you here? Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: I'm freezing. Let me check.\n\nSpeaker B: Let me speak from my heart. What the.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, I think it's okay. Let's go further.\n\nSpeaker B: Where I stopped.\n\nSpeaker A: That you are going to acquire 15 or 50, I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker B: 15, 50, 50 users during six months. Then we can include mock interviews from for with the recruiter and with design lead. And then we can scale. We can take another segments for it. For example, we can include or acquire product managers, developers and others potential segments. And the best way is to just sell in the future this for one of English schools maybe.\n\nSpeaker A: Are you here? You said Your goal is 50 people. Does it mean 50 people who are paying your monthly or how it should work?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, the model is subscription, the main idea subscription. And I think 50 people with lifetime value more than two months, two, three months.\n\nSpeaker A: So am I right that you are going to have 50,000 rubles per month without your brother?\n\nSpeaker B: Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: So it's. It's a pity that I don't have brother at all.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: So. And do you plan to use some instruments for tracking your progress? For instance, like we have with you or maybe some. Or meetings after Session or something like else. So sorry, is it Kate backward on you or it's ridiculous cat.\n\nSpeaker B: Where is.\n\nSpeaker A: There is no one under of pillow or what? Yes. Idiot. Crazy idiot.\n\nSpeaker B: Idiot. Crazy idiot. I'm not sure about instruments right now because I think I just want to start acquire people and I think it would be better to get some feedback from them. For example, just call after two weeks with users and try to understand why they became why they came to the club and what they did expect. And is it enough now or they need something else? Maybe. I think I will use granola just to summarize the the whole meeting and give some interesting thoughts to participants after it. After the meeting. And I think that's enough for the start.\n\nSpeaker A: I have a hypothesis why people join to you because they would like to option to say find me in the club. So can you share feedback from your students to me? What was a positive moment? Mainly.\n\nSpeaker B: The main positive moment is the ability to speak English because for people it's really interesting to have a live practice and live speaking with other designers. The negative. I think the most negative thing is the hardness level.\n\nSpeaker A: What level?\n\nSpeaker B: Level of hard. Hard of. It was just hard topic for them because sometimes by the way, in Russian. In Russian it's not too easy to discuss on this topic about dark patterns, about empathy in English, it's more harder for them. Also for Dania, It were some negative moments. Additional negative moments. For example, it was meeting without presentation. It was our topic. It was not like ping pong format. And it was maybe late for him, but he compared our meeting with his English lessons. It was not lesson on my meeting, so I think the comparison.\n\nSpeaker A: Is not.\n\nSpeaker B: Relevant. Yeah, and also positive things that I'm a good facilitator. I heard this from Kate and from Max, the other designer and he really likes the format because he already visited some English clubs in last year in Krasnodar and he really likes this format. And also he really likes to speak with other designers.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, I'm not sure that format is a good word. I'm not sure that it exists in English in this way.\n\nSpeaker B: But maybe I suppose both. Yes, it's okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: And one question regarding AI. What do you think about timing that we need to have AI assistant.\n\nSpeaker B: That.\n\nSpeaker A: Will be fully comparable with us? I mean, currently you even don't see difference between AI photo and usual photo. And sometimes we have AI models and we hear no difference between human voice and model voice. So how you evaluate the timing when such kind of models will be in place so they can join to your meeting and speak with you like a human.\n\nSpeaker B: I think maybe two years or less maybe. But I think this type of meeting more about is more about.\n\nSpeaker A: Experience.\n\nSpeaker B: And about sharing experience between designers. Because if you want to connect AI and AI will discuss it will be to generic. There will be no real experience from AI. It will be generic. Thoughts And I see I. I think that live and community formats will be. Interesting for people in AI era so I bet on community products. Now.\n\nSpeaker A: Your friend jmek disturbed me so I'm not sure that I catch the main thought from your speech.\n\nSpeaker B: So as I understand I think AI can give you a real experience. So the conversation will be a little bit generic. It will sound. It will sound like real conversation but the topic will be generic and there will be no real experience from AI model. You can share. You can. Yeah, that's it.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Am I right that you. You mean that AI can't provide you humans experience in specific themes where you are expert? For instance regarding me, if I'm writing with AI for instance any themes regarding health I feel that AI has very deep learning and it would be interesting for me having it in speaking as well. But where I'm an expert in for instance in some details regarding financial models I feel the same as you.\n\nSpeaker B: That's why I focused on designers because that's a bit specific industry with. With different opinions. So there are some UX laws, UX patterns and it's common in the whole industry. But my experience or someone else experience is different and if you're talking with the other designer you can discuss same cases and share your experience with others and AI can do this because there is no way I experience that's not the person.\n\nSpeaker A: So I and Gen GPT wrote your negative feedback about AI so we will. We will provide it to Vasilis kroko and so P9 CBR. Okay, we have six minutes left. Do you have any theme for discussion?\n\nSpeaker B: Short?\n\nSpeaker A: Some short maybe.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah. You can. You can try to answer the question just because I want to hear. I don't want to only speak. I want to hear too Try to answer the question. Where is the line between good marketing and. Dark pattern? Well.\n\nSpeaker A: For me it depends on feedback from users. If you consolidate it, for instance your pattern may be dark but if your user is happy. So for me it's not a problem. But if you're. What is the metric? Not CC NPS is it. It's a talk in this sphere.\n\nSpeaker B: Net Promoter Score Recommendation index like this. Yeah, it's okay. I think maybe customer satisfaction Index. That's another one.\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, customer satisfaction is okay. So for me is your. For instance, if your decrease in expenditure on marketing, for instance 10% and your decrease in customer loyalty or how to say so only 1%. For me it's okay to use such kind of marketing even if it contains some dark patterns. But if you decrease expenditure marketing and your NPS decrease as well. So it's not a good way for me because your retention will be shorter than it can be. I'm not sure that I have an answer that it's a red line, strict red line. It's always pros and cons of this decision. So. And it's. It's evident for me and for my company and for my budget that runs much better.\n\nSpeaker B: So.\n\nSpeaker A: Maybe I can use some dark patterns or if I correctly understand your question.\n\nSpeaker B: It'S okay. Okay. I think. Do we have time or we have three minutes left. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: I have a question if you don't mind.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: So I'm going to finalize the recommendation from AI regarding our mistakes and it can be interesting to compare it with with our self check. So what do you think the most common mistakes for you and yeah, it's articles.\n\nSpeaker B: I think articles. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: What else?\n\nSpeaker B: I think grammar when you use words. For example, he has or he have. I don't know how to say it in English. Okay. And times.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. So me too. And I would add some wrong constructions in sentences. Also I feel that sometimes my questions are wrong in terms of grammar. And. So I. I hope this is the most common and it would be quite easy to. To trace it and correct. But articles are ridiculous I would say.\n\nSpeaker B: So the mistakes like this annoying, annoying.\n\nSpeaker A: Annoying and complicated thing for me for.\n\nSpeaker B: Instance, maybe same Apple.\n\nSpeaker A: Same. Okay, 30 minutes left. I'm stopping our recording today. I have two one for simplifying our process.",

You can. Yeah, that's it.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Am I right that you. You mean that AI can't provide you humans experience in specific themes where you are expert? For instance regarding me, if I'm writing with AI for instance any themes regarding health I feel that AI has very deep learning and it would be interesting for me having it in speaking as well. But where I'm an expert in for instance in some details regarding financial models I feel the same as you.\n\nSpeaker B: That's why I focused on designers because that's a bit specific industry with. With different opinions. So there are some UX laws, UX patterns and it's common in the whole industry. But my experience or someone else experience is different and if you're talking with the other designer you can discuss same cases and share your experience with others and AI can do this because there is no way I experience that's not the person.\n\nSpeaker A: So I and Gen GPT wrote your negative feedback about AI so we will. We will provide it to Vasilis kroko and so P9 CBR. Okay, we have six minutes left. Do you have any theme for discussion?\n\nSpeaker B: Short?\n",

I want to hear too Try to answer the question. Where is the line between good marketing and. Dark pattern? Well.\n\nSpeaker A: For me it depends on feedback from users. If you consolidate it, for instance your pattern may be dark but if your user is happy. So for me it's not a problem. But if you're. What is the metric? Not CC NPS is it. It's a talk in this sphere.\n\nSpeaker B: Net Promoter Score Recommendation index like this. Yeah, it's okay. I think maybe customer satisfaction Index. That's another one.\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, customer satisfaction is okay. So for me is your. For instance, if your decrease in expenditure on marketing, for instance 10% and your decrease in customer loyalty or how to say so only 1%. For me it's okay to use such kind of marketing even if it contains some dark patterns. But if you decrease expenditure marketing and your NPS decrease as well. So it's not a good way for me because your retention will be shorter than it can be. I'm not sure that I have an answer that it's a red line, strict red line. It's always pros and cons of this decision. So. And it's. It's evident for me and for my company and for my budget that runs much better.\n\nSpeaker B: So.\n",

And also I want to include a presentation for the meeting or Figma board or Miraboard just because it's more interesting to interact during the meeting.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. And what <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: do you have any strategy for this project | 'For' is the correct preposition for strategy regarding a project.\">do you have any strategy on this project</mark> or. Or what is the hypothesis for it?\n\nSpeaker B: Overall? I think I have a hypothesis for the whole project that I can acquire 50 people during six months. If I can do this, I can scale up the whole project because if I acquire 50 people, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: it's enough people for growth. | Repetition and incorrect phrase 'growing up to grow up' needs simplification.\">it's enough people. It's enough people on the market for the growing up to grow up.</mark> This, this project just. I can use the same way to acquire people as first 50 users. And then I can transform the offer from just speaking clubs to preparing for interviews. Also I can add mock interviews <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: as an individual service for some participants of the club | Missing article 'an' and 'the' before nouns.\">as individual service for some participants of club</mark>. And. We can. We can try. Bruce, are you here? Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: I'm freezing. Let me check.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Let me speak from | The phrase 'Let me speak from my heart' needs a preposition 'from'.\">Let me speak</mark> from my heart. What the.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, I think it's okay. Let's go further.\n\nSpeaker B: Where I stopped.\n\nSpeaker A: That you are going to acquire 15 or 50, I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker B: 15, 50, 50 users <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: over six | The preposition 'over' is more appropriate in this context for duration.\">during six</mark> months. Then we can include mock interviews <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: for | The preposition 'from' is unnecessary and should be removed.\">from for</mark> <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: with a | Change the article 'the' to 'a' for indefinite reference.\">with the</mark> recruiter and with design lead. And then we can scale. We can take another segments for it. For example, we can include or acquire product managers, developers and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: other potential | 'Other' should be used because 'potential segments' is singular in context.\">others potential</mark> segments. And the best way is to just sell in <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: this in the future to | Correct order and prepositions needed for clarity.\">the future this for</mark> one of English schools maybe.\n\nSpeaker A: Are you here? You said Your goal is 50 people. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Does it mean 50 people who are paying you monthly | 'Your' is a possessive adjective and should be 'you', the object pronoun.\">Does it mean 50 people who are paying your monthly</mark> or how it should work?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, the model is subscription, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: the main idea is subscription | Verb 'is' is missing and needed for correct sentence structure.\">the main idea subscription</mark>. And I think <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: 50 people with a lifetime value of more than | Missing article and correct preposition 'of'.\">50 people with lifetime value more than</mark> two months, two, three months.\n\nSpeaker A: So am I right that you are going to have 50,000 rubles per month without your brother?\n\nSpeaker B: Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: So it's. It's a pity that <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I don't have a brother at all | Missing article 'a' before the singular noun.\">I don't have brother at all</mark>.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: So. And do you plan to use some instruments for tracking your progress? For instance, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: like the ones we have | This phrase is awkward and does not clearly convey the intended meaning.\">like we have with you</mark> or maybe some. Or meetings after Session or <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: something else | The correct phrase is 'something else.'\">something like else</mark>. So sorry, is it <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Kate back there with you | The phrase should be clearer, possibly intending 'Kate is back there with you.'\">Kate backward on you</mark> or it's ridiculous cat.\n\nSpeaker B: Where is.\n\nSpeaker A: There is <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: no one under the pillow | The correct phrase is 'under the pillow.'\">no one under of pillow</mark> or what? Yes. Idiot. Crazy idiot.\n\nSpeaker B: Idiot. Crazy idiot. I'm not sure about instruments right now because I think <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I just want to start acquiring | 'Acquire' should be in the gerund form 'acquiring' after 'start.'\">I just want to start acquire</mark> people and I think it would be better to get some feedback from them. For example, just call after two weeks with users and try to understand why they became why they came to the club and what they <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: expected. And is it enough | The verb 'did' is unnecessary here.\">did expect. And is it enough</mark> now or they need something else? Maybe. I think I will use <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: notes just to summarize the whole meeting | 'Granola' seems to be a mistake; 'notes' makes more sense in context, and 'the' is repeated.\">granola just to summarize the the whole meeting</mark> and give some interesting thoughts to participants after it. After the meeting. And I think that's enough for the start.\n\nSpeaker A: I have a hypothesis why people <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: join you because | 'Join' does not require the preposition 'to.'\">join to you because</mark> they would like to option to say find me in the club. So can you share feedback from your students to me? What was a positive moment? Mainly.\n\nSpeaker B: The main positive moment is the ability to speak English because for people it's really interesting to have a live practice and live speaking with other designers. The negative. I think the most negative thing is <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: the level of difficulty | 'Hardness level' is not a standard English expression.\">the hardness level</mark>.\n\nSpeaker A: What level?\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Level of difficulty. | The phrase 'level of hard' is incorrect. 'Level of difficulty' is more appropriate.\">Level of hard.</mark> Hard of. It was <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: just a hard topic | A determiner 'a' is needed before 'hard topic.'\">just hard topic</mark> for them because sometimes by the way, in Russian. In Russian it's not too easy to discuss on this topic about dark patterns, about empathy in English, it's <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: harder for | 'More harder' is redundant. 'Harder' is sufficient.\">more harder for</mark> them. Also for Dania, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: There were | 'It were' is incorrect. 'There were' is the correct form.\">It were</mark> some negative moments. Additional negative moments. For example, it was meeting without presentation. It was our topic. It was not like ping pong format. And it was maybe late for him, but he compared our meeting with his English lessons. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: It was not a lesson | A determiner 'a' is needed before 'lesson.'\">It was not lesson</mark> on my meeting, so I think the comparison.\n\nSpeaker A: Is not.\n\nSpeaker B: Relevant. Yeah, and also positive things that I'm a good facilitator. I heard this from Kate and from Max, the other designer and he really likes the format because he already visited some English clubs <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: last year in Krasnodar | 'In last year' should be 'last year.'\">in last year in Krasnodar</mark> and he really likes this format. And also he really likes to speak with other designers.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay, I'm not sure that format is a good word. I'm not sure that it exists in English in this way.\n\nSpeaker B: But maybe I suppose both. Yes, it's okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: And one question <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: What do you think about the timing when | The article 'the' is needed before 'timing,' and 'when' is the correct conjunction for specifying time.\">regarding AI. What do you think about timing that we need</mark> to have AI assistant.\n\nSpeaker B: That.\n\nSpeaker A: Will be fully comparable with us? I mean,<mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: currently you don't even see a difference | Correct order is 'don't even see' and an article 'a' is needed before 'difference.'\"> currently you even don't see difference between</mark> AI photo and usual photo. And sometimes we have AI models and we hear no difference between human voice and model voice. So <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: how you evaluate the timing of when such kinds | 'Kinds' should be plural and 'of' is necessary before 'when.'\">how you evaluate the timing when such kind</mark> of models will be in place so <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: they can join your meeting | 'Join' does not require the preposition 'to.'\">they can join to your meeting</mark> and speak with you like a human.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I think maybe two years or less. | Repetition of 'maybe' is unnecessary.\">I think maybe two years or less maybe.</mark> But I think this type of meeting more about is more about.\n\nSpeaker A: Experience.\n\nSpeaker B: And about sharing experience between designers. Because if you want to connect AI and AI will discuss <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: it will be too generic | 'Too' is the correct word instead of 'to' for indicating excess.\">it will be to generic</mark>. There will be no real experience from AI. It will be generic. Thoughts And I see I. I think that live and community formats will be. Interesting for people in AI era so I bet on community products. Now.\n\nSpeaker A: Your friend jmek disturbed me <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I'm not sure that I caught the main thought | The past tense 'caught' is needed for consistency with 'I'm not sure.'\">so I'm not sure that I catch the main thought from</mark> your speech.\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: So as far as I understand, I think | The phrase 'as far as I understand' is correct usage.\">So as I understand I think</mark> AI can give you a real experience. So the conversation will be a little bit generic. It will sound. It will sound like real conversation but <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: the topic will be a generic one | Requires an article and clarification for countable noun 'topic.'\">the topic will be generic</mark> and there will be no real experience from AI model. You can share. You can. Yeah, that's it.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Am I right that you. You mean that <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: AI can't provide you with human experience | Incorrect use of 'humans' should be 'human,' and 'provide you with' is the correct collocation.\">AI can't provide you humans experience</mark> in specific themes where you are expert? For instance regarding me, if I'm writing with AI for instance any themes regarding health I feel that AI has very deep learning and it would be interesting for me having it in speaking as well. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: But where I'm an expert, for instance, in some details | Misplaced preposition 'in' results in redundant phrase; needs clarification.\">But where I'm an expert in for instance in some details</mark> regarding financial models I feel the same as you.\n\nSpeaker B: That's why I focused on designers because that's a bit specific industry with. With different opinions. So there are some UX laws, UX patterns and it's common in the whole industry. But my experience or someone else experience is different and <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: if you're talking with another designer you can discuss the same cases | Uses 'another' instead of 'the other,' and includes article 'the' before 'same cases.'\">if you're talking with the other designer you can discuss same cases</mark> and share your experience with others and AI can do this because there is no way I experience that's not the person.\n\nSpeaker A: So I and Gen GPT wrote your negative feedback about AI so we will. We will provide it to Vasilis kroko and so P9 CBR. Okay, we have six minutes left. Do you have any theme for discussion?\n\nSpeaker B: Short?\n\nSpeaker A: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: Some might be short | 'Some short maybe' is not grammatically correct; 'might be' is needed to convey possibility, correcting the verb issue.\">Some short maybe</mark>.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah. You can. You can try to answer the question just because I want to hear. I don't want to only speak. I want to hear too Try to answer the question. Where is the line between good marketing and. Dark pattern? Well.\n\nSpeaker A: For me it depends on feedback from users. If you consolidate it, for instance your pattern may be dark but if your user is happy. So for me it's not a problem. But if you're. What is the metric? Not CC NPS <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: isn't it | The phrase should confirm with a tag question format for agreement.\">is it</mark>. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: It's talked | The correct verb form in context is 'talked,' meaning it has been discussed.\">It's a talk</mark> in this sphere.\n\nSpeaker B: Net Promoter Score Recommendation index like this. Yeah, it's okay. I think maybe customer satisfaction Index. That's another one.\n\nSpeaker A: Yes, customer satisfaction is okay. So for me is your. For instance, <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: if you decrease expenditure on marketing | The phrase requires a subject-verb agreement correction by removing 'your'.\">if your decrease in expenditure on marketing</mark>, for instance 10% and your decrease in customer loyalty or how to say so only 1%. For me it's okay to use such kind of marketing even if it contains some dark patterns. But <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: if you decrease marketing expenditure | The word order needs correction for proper context, 'marketing expenditure' is standard usage.\">if you decrease expenditure marketing</mark> and your NPS decrease as well. So it's not a good way for me because your <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: retention might be shorter | 'Might be' conveys possibility, whereas 'will be' is definitive; context suggests the former.\">retention will be shorter</mark> than it can be. I'm not sure that I have an answer that it's <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: a strict red line. | Repetition is redundant; should be concise as 'a strict red line.'\">a red line, strict red line.</mark> It's always <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: pros and cons to this decision | The phrase 'pros and cons to' is the correct preposition use.\">pros and cons of this decision</mark>. So. And it's. It's evident for me and for my company and for my budget that runs much better.\n\nSpeaker B: So.\n\nSpeaker A: Maybe I can use some dark patterns or <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: if I understand your question correctly | Incorrect adverb placement.\">if I correctly understand your question</mark>.\n\nSpeaker B: It'S okay. Okay. I think. Do we have time or we have three minutes left. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: I have a question if you don't mind.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: So I'm going to finalize the recommendation from AI regarding our mistakes and it can be interesting to <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: compare it with | Repetition of the preposition &quot;with.&quot;\">compare it with with</mark> our self check. So what do you think the most common mistakes for you and yeah, it's articles.\n\nSpeaker B: I think articles. Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: What else?\n\nSpeaker B: <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I think of grammar when you use | The preposition 'of' is needed to connect 'think' with 'grammar'.\">I think grammar when you use</mark> words. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: For example, he has or he had. | 'Has' and 'have' are not parallel because they belong to different forms; it should be 'has' and 'had' to show a contrast in different tenses.\">For example, he has or he have.</mark> I don't know how to say it in English. Okay. And times.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: So do I. And I would add some | 'So me too' is incorrect. The correct form is 'So do I'.\">So me too. And I would add some</mark> wrong constructions in <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: it and it would be quite easy to. | The subject 'it' is missing before 'would'.\">sentences. Also I feel that</mark> sometimes my questions are wrong in terms of grammar. And. So I. I hope this is the most common and it would be quite easy to. To trace it and correct. But articles are ridiculous I would say.\n\nSpeaker B: So <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: mistakes like these are annoying. | 'Mistakes like this' should be plural 'these', and the phrase should be completed with a verb.\">the mistakes like this annoying, annoying.</mark>\n\nSpeaker A: Annoying and complicated <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: thing for me.\n\nFor instance, maybe the same apple. | 'Instance, maybe same Apple' should be 'For instance, maybe the same apple.' for correct usage and article inclusion.\">thing for me for.\n\nSpeaker B: Instance, maybe same Apple.</mark>\n\nSpeaker A: Same. Okay, 30 minutes left. I'm stopping our recording today. <mark class=\"grammar-error\" title=\"Correct: I have one for simplifying | The phrase 'two one' is incorrect when the intended meaning was likely to indicate having one item, task, or subject. 'Two' and 'one' cannot be combined in this way.\">I have two one for simplifying</mark> our process.",
